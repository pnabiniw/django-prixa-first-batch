1. API stands for Application Programmable Interface
2. API is a communication medium among two or more entities like Frontend-Backend, 
Mobile-Backend, Backend-Backend
3. Communication is done is JSON language
4. JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. It is the way to represent an object
    => JSON looks like dictionary of python, object of Javascript

    {
        "name": "Jon",
        "email": "jon@email.com",
        "age": 26
    }

     {
        'name': "Jon",
        "email": "jon@email.com",
        "age": 26
    } => This is invalid JSON because of single quote at name key

    => JSON only supports double quotes

5. There are broadly two types of APIs
    => REST APIs
    => SOAP APIs

    SOAP APIs use XML as communication language
    <name>Jon</name>
    <age>24</age>
    <address>KTM</address>  # XML format


    REST APIs use JSON as communication language
    => REST stands Representational State Transfer

6. Using DRF we will create API endpoints
