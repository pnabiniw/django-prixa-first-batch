There are three types of table relations
1. One-One relation
2. One-Many relation
3. Many-Many relation



1. One-Many Relation
=> This relation is used to group the items under certain topic/category
For example: Classroom => Student, Menu => Food, Team => Players, ChatRoom => Users


2. One-One Relation
=> If single and unique item of a category exist then it is One-One relation
=> User => UserProfile, Lock => Key, User => Account in One Bank


3. Many-Many Relation
=> If multiple entity of a table can be related with multiple entity of another table then it is Many-Many Relation
=> User => Role, Course => Content, Student => Subject


How to use these relations in Django?
1. For One-Many relation we use models.ForeignKey() in Django
2. For One-One relation we use models.OneToOne() in Django
3. For Many-Many relation we use models.ManyToMany() in Django
