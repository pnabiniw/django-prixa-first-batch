Types of Authentication
1. Basic Authentication (Not recommended)
    => In every request we should send username and password

2. Session Authentication
    => The user session is stored in the browser's cookies
    => The sessionId is sent to the server in every request

3. Token Authentication
    => This is mostly used in the APIs
    => A user token is stored in the backend database
    => This token is sent to the frontend user as a API response
    => In every request the token is sent in the request header

4. JWT Authentication (JSON Web Token)
=> This is also used in APIs
=> The major difference in token and JWT authentication is JWT doesn't 
   store the user token in the backend databaser
=> The JWT tokens are simply encrypted and decrypted but not saved anywhere in database
